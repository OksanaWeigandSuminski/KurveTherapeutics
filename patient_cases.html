						<b style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 17px;">Letter dated 28 August 2019, from patient’s daughter</b><br>
						I wanted to take a moment to thank you. My father [GS] was diagnosed with Parkinson’s by Dr S. in February of 2017, at that time he was beginning to really struggle with daily life. 
						He had started a rapid decline in health both physically and mentally. We were seeing changes almost weekly. He was having a hard time picking up his feet to walk as he hunched forward, bringing a spoon to his mouth was becoming a tearful struggle, his tremors would come and go, the depression was great and getting worse. 
						He would stare away and we would all try to bring him back to reality. He was sleeping throughout the day. Around December of 2018 my Dad was asked by Dr. S, a Neurologist that runs the neuro movement center at [clinic in California], to please give consideration to a new treatment for brain disorders. 
						They had begun to see great success in his patients that had been using the Kurve system. We all discussed and figured we had nothing to lose and he had to try it. My Father received a prescription for IgG and information on a company to contact to purchase a nasal delivery system that would possibly help him with Parkinson’s.<br>
						<b style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 17px;">Fast forward: 8/27/2019</b><br>
						My Father has been using the IgG with the Kurve nasal delivery system every 2 weeks. He is back at work full time, driving himself. He no longer shuffles. Eating is second nature with no more struggles to bring his hand to mouth and drooling is completely gone. The tremor in his hands are almost totally gone, just a slight bit left. 
						He has gone back to working out with his trainer 3 days a week. The distant stare is gone. He is engaged and present. The depression is completely under control. His employees say “[GS] is taking a break from Parkinson’s”. No one can believe the change. I wanted you to know how thankful we are to you and your company. 
						We tell everyone about our experience and we hope and pray that more Doctors will be willing to think outside the box and try new treatments for devastating brain diseases. This is something we never thought possible.
