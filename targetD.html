						Kurve products have favorable clinical evidence of disease-modifying activity in at least four neurodegenerative diseases. 
						Market revenues in some cases are for drug products effective for brief periods (3-6 months), after which the efficacy is lost, patient decline accelerates and the use of the drug is discontinued. 
						With Kurve, efficacy tends to continue for years and in a number of cases actually reverses the course of the disease. Thus, there is significant potential to grow these markets.

						<b style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 17px;">Letter dated 28 August 2019, from patient’s daughter</b><br>
						I wanted to take a moment to thank you. My father [GS] was diagnosed with Parkinson’s by Dr S. in February of 2017, at that time he was beginning to really struggle with daily life. 
						He had started a rapid decline in health both physically and mentally. We were seeing changes almost weekly. He was having a hard time picking up his feet to walk as he hunched forward, bringing a spoon to his mouth was becoming a tearful struggle, his tremors would come and go, the depression was great and getting worse. 
						He would stare away and we would all try to bring him back to reality. He was sleeping throughout the day. Around December of 2018 my Dad was asked by Dr. S, a Neurologist that runs the neuro movement center at [clinic in California], to please give consideration to a new treatment for brain disorders. 
						They had begun to see great success in his patients that had been using the Kurve system. We all discussed and figured we had nothing to lose and he had to try it. My Father received a prescription for IgG and information on a company to contact to purchase a nasal delivery system that would possibly help him with Parkinson’s.<br>
						<b style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 17px;">Fast forward: 8/27/2019</b><br>
						My Father has been using the IgG with the Kurve nasal delivery system every 2 weeks. He is back at work full time, driving himself. He no longer shuffles. Eating is second nature with no more struggles to bring his hand to mouth and drooling is completely gone. The tremor in his hands are almost totally gone, just a slight bit left. 
						He has gone back to working out with his trainer 3 days a week. The distant stare is gone. He is engaged and present. The depression is completely under control. His employees say “[GS] is taking a break from Parkinson’s”. No one can believe the change. I wanted you to know how thankful we are to you and your company. 
						We tell everyone about our experience and we hope and pray that more Doctors will be willing to think outside the box and try new treatments for devastating brain diseases. This is something we never thought possible.

			 <!-- <h2>Alzheimer’s Disease</h2> -->
			 With US prevalence estimated at 5.8 million, <span class="lead" style="color: #0f568a;">Alzheimer’s Disease</span> is the only top-10 cause of death in the United States with no known cure. 
			 It is the sixth-leading cause of death and is the fifth-leading cause of death among those age 65 and older in the US. 
			 It is also estimated to be the most-expensive disease in the nation. 
			 The 2018 cost of caring for Americans with Alzheimer’s and other dementias is about $277 billion, not including unpaid caregiving by 16 million Americans annually providing an estimated 18.5 billion hours, valued in aggregate at $234 billion. 
			 Approved treatments address only symptoms; they do not modify the disease in a fashion seen in some Kurve Therapeutics patients (please see Appendix 1). 
			 Global revenues for Alzheimer’s drugs were $18 billion in 2018. There is opportunity to grow the market significantly with an effectively- delivered, disease-modifying drug.

			 <!-- <h2>Parkinson’s Disease</h2> -->
			 <span class="lead" style="color: #0f568a;">Parkinson’s Disease</span> afflicts about 930,000 US patients, with 2030 prevalence forecast to grow to 1.2 million. While for some patients the symptoms can be treated effectively for years, there are no approved drugs that treat the underlying neurodegenerative process. 
			 Global revenues for Parkinson’s drugs were $4.5 billion in 2018. There is substantial opportunity to enlarge this market with a therapy yielding the disease-modifying experiences seen in some Kurve patients (please see Appendix 2).

			 <!-- <h2>Lewy Body Dementia</h2> -->
			 <span class="lead" style="color: #0f568a;">Lewy Body Dementia (LBD)</span> affects about 1.4 million individuals and their families in the United States. It is the third-most-common dementia in the US, after Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia. 
			 There are no approved treatments demonstrated to slow or stop the brain cell damage caused by Lewy body dementia. Global LBD drug revenues were $3.5 billion in 2018. Several LBD patients have benefitted significantly from Kurve treatments (patient case reports pending).

				<!-- <h2>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</h2> -->
				<span class="lead" style="color: #0f568a;">Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</span> is a rare disease, with about 16,000 patients in the US. There are only two drugs approved for the treatment of ALS: Sanofi’s Rilutek (riluzole) and Mitsubishi Tanabe’s Radicava (edaravone). 
				The drugs were special cases in terms of FDA approval; they did not meet the standard regulatory requirements for approval, but due to the increase in survival of patients, they were granted approval. Drug sales for ALS in 2017 were collectively about $200 million in the US, Japan and major European markets (Germany, France, UK, Italy and Spain).
